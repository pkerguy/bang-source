m.welcome_title = Wendigo Attack
m.welcome = Hmmm... there is indeed somethin' going on here; the spirits \
  are strong.  But this isn't what has us worried.  No, this is something that \
  is as old as the great grandfather oaks, probably even older.  It is called the \
  @=b(Wendigo Attack)

m.welcome2 = I'm going to scout out ahead to see if I can find any clues to the \
  unsolved mystery.  The @=b(Stormcaller) here will teach you about the Wendigo.

m.intro = @=b(Wendigo Attack) isn't like the other scenarios you've been \
  playin'.  You ain't claiming nothin' or rustling nothin', yer just tryin' \
  to stay alive when the demon @=b(Wendigo) come screamin' across the board!

m.intro2 = The @=b(Wendigo) are terrifyin' creatures.  They have big gapin' \
  maws that eat up everything in their path, and their claws will rend you \
  in two like nothin'.  You don't never want to feel the chill of that \
  ice-heart.

m.stayin_alive_title = Surviving the Attack
m.stayin_alive = Lucky for you, there's two ways to survive the \
  Wendigo Attack:  1) By holding the @=b(Sacred Talisman) or 2) By standin' \
  on a spot covered with an @=b(Active Petroglyph of Protection).

m.talisman = This is the @=b(Sacred Talisman).  Move your Stormcaller \
  unit over there and pick it up.

m.got_talisman = Your unit will now be protected from the @=b(Wendigo) \
  for as long as they continue to hold the @=b(Talisman).

m.got_talisman2 = If the unit is killed, shot by the @=b(Sharpshooter), or \
  has a @=b(Stick Up!) card played on them, they'll drop the @=b(Talisman) and \
  any other unit can then pick it up.

m.petroglyph = Those light blue squares on the ground are the \
  @=b(Active Petroglyphs). The dim circles are @=b(Inactive Petroglyphs).

m.petroglyph2 = As you can see, the enemy units are trying to reach the \
  @=b(Active Petroglyphs) so they will be safe when the Wendigo shows up.  \
  That Dreamcatcher won't make it in time though, she was too far away.

m.wendigo_nigh = Hush, the @=b(Wendigo) are comin'.  You can tell they're \
  about to strike because the world goes dark and it gets real quiet.

m.wendigo_nigh2 = When the lights go out, you've got exactly @=b(four ticks) to \
  get all your units to safety before the @=b(Wendigo) strike.  Luckily, \
  you're currently safe because you have the Talisman.

m.wendigo_passed =  It won't matter how healthy your units are.  It don't \
  even help if they're wearin' an @=b(Iron Plate).  When the @=b(Wendigo) come \
  through, any units not holdin' a @=b(Talisman) or standin' on an \
  @=b(Active Petroglyph) are demon's dinner.

m.wendigo_scoring_title = Scoring
m.wendigo_scoring = You will see a count of survivals on each players' marker.  \
  You'll also notice that you scored some points.  Every unit \
  that survives a Wendigo Attack scores @=b(15 points) regardless of whether \
  they was standin' on a @=b(Petroglyph) or holdin' the @=b(Talisman).

m.wendigo_scoring2 = However, surviving by holding the Talisman AND standing \
 on Active Petroglyph will score you an extra @=b(25 points).  So if you have \
 the chance, be sure to move yer talisman carryin' units onto petroglyphs for \
 a higher score.

m.wendigo_switches_title = Petroglyph Switches
m.wendigo_switches = The last thing I'll tell you about are the \
  @=b(Petroglyph Switches).  As you learned, only the @=b(Active Petroglyphs) \
  protected you from the @=b(Wendigo).

m.wendigo_switches2 = This here is a @=b(Petroglyph Switch).  If you move one \
  of your units onto it, the @=b(Active Petroglyphs) will become @=b(Inactive) \
  and vice-versa.

m.trick = As you might already be thinkin', you can fool your opponents into \
  thinking they are safe by flippin' the switch at the last second, right before \
  the @=b(Wendigo) come chargin' through.

m.wendigo_switches3 = Let's get that Buffalo Rider!  She thinks she's safe there, \
  but move your Big Shot onto that switch now!

m.switch_toggled = Notice that all the @=b(Petroglyphs) switched \
  from @=b(Active) to @=b(Inactive) and vice-versa.  Once a switch has been \
  flipped, that switch can't be flipped again until 4 ticks after the unit \
  moves off of the switch.

m.switch_toggled2 = Haha!  Sometimes a screamin', ice-hearted phantasm can be a \
  welcome sight!  With some cleverness you could also have parked your units \
  on the Inactive Petroglyphs first, making them all safe when that Switch was \
  flipped.

m.done_title = Still Alive!
m.done = Now yow know how to survive @=b(Wendigo Attack).  We should move \
  on in our journey before the Wendigo return.  We have not yet found the \
  mystery, but I'll reward you nonetheless.
