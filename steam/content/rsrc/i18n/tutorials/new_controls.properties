m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Pardner
m.welcome = Howdy!  Glad yer gonna help me, but movin' West aint no easy picnic.  \
  There's danger all about, and nine times o'ten you'll be right in the thick of it.  \
  So, consider this yer crash course in not gettin' plugged.  Click this here \
  window and let's begin...

m.camera_pan_title = Controllin' the Camera
m.camera_pan = I always say keep yer eyes peeled \
  fer trouble and trouble won't bother you none.  You can move the view around \
  with the @=b(W, A, S) and @=b(D) keys. You can also use the @=b(Arrow Keys) if \
  yer a southpaw.

m.camera_zoom = You can switch between zoom levels with the @=b(C) key and you \
  can rotate with the middle mouse wheel or the @=b(Q) and @=b(E) keys.  Give \
  'er a spin.

m.show_unit_title = Units
m.show_unit = Let's get you aquainted with yer forces.  That there is me, \
  the @=b(Old Codger).  I'm one of the hands on the ranch that you'll command.  
  I'm what's called a Big Shot Unit, but we'll get into that later.

m.click_unit = You can select a unit by clickin' on 'em, or by pressing \
  the @=b(TAB) key. The TAB key will quickly move you to any units that are \
  awaiting commands.\n \n\
  Select me and let's get me movin'.

m.click_to_move = Now you can see where a unit can move to by its range of \
  movement squares.  Notice also that the one you are hovering over \
  highlights.  Click any square and the unit will move there.

m.observe_ticks = I can see yer no stranger to givin' orders.  This wagon \
  train may make it out West yet.  \n \n\
  Now have a look at them little blue ticks down near the unit's feet. \ 
  Watch 'em slowly add up to the whole ring.

m.move_again = Those ticks tell ya how long ya have to wait before you can \
  move the unit again.  Every few seconds one of them ticks will fill in \
  and when they're all filled in, it's ready to go!\n \n\
  Once it's set move it again back this 'a way.

m.preload_move_title = Advanced Orders
m.preload_move = Sometimes you know what you want to do before yer unit \
  is ready to go.  Fortunately, you can give @=b(Advance Orders) to yer unit in \
  the same way you give normal orders.  If a unit ain't ready yet it can \
  still take your orders and just execute them as soon as it can.

m.preload_move2 = Try givin' the unit an advance move order.  It's \
  probably ready to move already, if so move it once first and then tell it \
  to move someplace else right after that.

m.examine_pending = Notice the little icon on the board lettin' ya know where \
  you told that unit to move.  When you hover yer mouse over a unit with an \
  advance order, it'll highlight its advance order icon in white.

m.redo_order = By the way, you can change a unit's advance order by selectin' \
  'em and giving 'em new orders any time before they execute their current \
  orders.  You can also cancel an order entirely by selecting a unit then right clicking.

m.click_to_highlight_attacks_title = Shootin' Yer Opponents
m.click_to_highlight_attacks = Now look at that!  Some unsavory customer gone \
  shown up on our rightful property.  This is what I mean about keepin' an eye \
  out fer danger.

m.click_to_highlight_attacks2 = Ouch!  That feller means business.  If you were \
  doubtin' his intentions at first, you'd be plum foolhardy to do so now.  Let's \
  teach 'im a lesson!

m.click_to_highlight_attacks3 =  Click yer unit and take a gander at the \
  crosshairs that show up on that varmint.  Those let you know you have moves \
  that can bring you into firing range.

m.click_to_attack = Now, there are a couple of ways you can shoot an opponent. \
  The simplest is to just click the unit that has crosshairs over it and your unit will \
  automatically figger out where to go to reach it.  Try that first.

m.move_and_attack = Now, there's another way to order an attack that you can \
  use when yer keen to do yer shootin' from a particular location.

m.move_and_attack2 = First click yer unit, then click on the ground where \
  ya want 'em to move, then click on the crosshairs of yer target. \
  (The crosshairs will go brown if movin' there will take the unit outta range, \
  so only click a ground tile nearby yer target, where the crosshairs are \
  white.  Try a @=b(Move and Shoot) command now.

m.move_double_click = That showed 'em!  By the way, if ya just want to shoot \
  anyone in range, you can double click the spot where you want to move and \
  yer unit will randomly pick from the available targets.

m.damage_and_respawn_title = Units' Health
m.damage_and_respawn = Last thing ye'll want to notice is yer units' health. \
  Take a gander at the bar down at the unit's feet that we showed ya earlier.

m.damage_and_respawn2 = You may notice that yer unit's bar is a little down \
  from getting shot, and that trespasser's bar is lookin' pretty low.  That'd be a \
  result of all them times you shot 'im.\n \n\
  All right, don't leave a job half done.  Finish 'im off.

m.damage_and_respawn3 = When a unit's health is completely gone it will die, but it \
  ain't out of the game permanently -- it will show back up after a few turns.  \
  On top of that, steam units leave a bit of wreckage on the \
  board which can block the way if they're knocked out in a tight spot.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = That takes care of that pesky intruder, good work!  Ya got \
  the hang of the basic controls.  No time fer lollygaggin', though.  Sun's \
  a-rising!  Let's give ya a little reward and then get these wagons West!
