m.welcome_title = Rustlin' Cattle!
m.welcome = What are we doin' way over here at this abandoned ranch?  \
  Well, I 'spose it's about time to tell ya all about @=b(Cattle Rustlin'), \
  one of the scenarios in this here game.  But before we do that, we need to \
  jabber a bit about yer @=b(Big Shot) units.

m.bigshot_intro_title = Big Shots
m.bigshot_intro = This here @=b(Cavalry) unit is a @=b(Big Shot) unit like me.  \
  Big Shots are important because they are more powerful than normal \
  units and some of them have special powers.  I'll let him tell you 'bout \
  the rest...

m.bigshot_intro_2 = Howdy!  I'm a master of @=b(Ground Units).  My trusty horse here \
  gives me the largest movement range of the Frontier Town Bigshots, and I also \
  have an ATTACK BONUS against other Ground Units.

m.enemy = Uh oh!  I guess this ranch aint quite so abandoned as we \
  figured.  That there no-good rustler is fixin' to rustle the cattle that we were \
  already fixin' to rustle... if ya follow.  Click yer @=b(Cavalry) unit and I'll \
  show ya somethin'.

m.squares = When you select yer @=b(Big Shot), yer moves are \
  highlighted in green instead of yellow.  That's a reminder that yer movin' yer \
  @=b(Big Shot).  Enough jawin', let's shoot that imposter!

m.cattle_intro_title = Brandin' Cattle
m.cattle_intro = There's a head o' @=b(Cattle) right there. \
  In @=b(Cattle Rustlin') yer @=b(Big Shot) is extra \
  important because they're the only unit on yer team that can brand cattle, \
  and brandin' cattle is how ya score points.

m.enemy_brand = That feller just beat us to the punch.  Notice that the \
  steer is now marked with his team color.  Also, down yonder in the @=b(Player \
  Status View) he just got 50 points fer brandin' that cow. 
  
m.brand_it = Fortunately, any @=b(Big Shot) can brand cattle, even cows that are currently \
  branded by somebody else.  You can track that bull down with yer Cavalry and \
  rebrand 'im as one of yer rightful own.  Move yer @=b(Big Shot) to one of the squares \
  next to that cow now.

m.cattle_scoring = Nice branding!  Yer a natural with that iron.  What's more, you now \
  have the 50 points for branding that cow and yer opponent has lost 50 points for \
  losin' that cow.

m.kill = See how he likes that one, huh!  Now get rid of that varmint \
  before he get's the notion to rebrand that cow back.  Go on, shoot 'im!

m.timer_title = Time's a Wastin'
m.timer = Yer a true rope and ringer.  Now take a gander in the upper \
  right corner where you'll see a fancy steam gauge.  That thar gauge lets ya \
  know how much time ya got left before the round ends.

m.winner = The cowpoke with the most points at the end of the round is the \
  big winner.  Don't let down yer guard if yer not in first place though.  \
  Ya earn more @=b(Scrip) fer finishin' second than third and more fer third than \
  fourth.

m.winner_2_title = Scrip
m.winner_2 = Speakin' of @=b(Scrip), Scrip is used to buy supplies at \
  the @=b(General Store), so yer gonna want to win games to get payed more.  \

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = There ain't much more to tell 'cept that in a real game yer gonna \
  have ta go iron to iron against several other cowpokes who'll be aimin' ta \
  steal yer cattle and shoot ya t'boot.

m.done_2 = You'll have to work out a strategy to protect yer herd and get out \
  there and brand the strays.  But first, I reckon' I aught to share in the \
  bounty of this here fine cow with ya.  C'mon, let's get back to the Wagons!
