m.welcome_title = Totem Building
m.welcome = There IS something going on here in these woods... but it's \
  nothing strange.  It's just @=b(Totem Building) -- muy bien!  Since \
  we're already out here I will teach you about it. 

m.welcome2 = As you might have guessed, @=b(Totem Building) involves \
  building @=b(Totem Poles).  To begin building a Totem Pole, you first \
  need a @=b(Totem Base).

m.different_sizes_title = Totem Bases and Totems
m.totem_base = This is a @=b(Totem Base).  There can be many of these \
  scattered about on the board.  Anyone can build totem poles on top of \
  this Totem Base by carrying @=b(Totems) over to the base and popping \
  them on top.

m.totem_piece = This is a @=b(Totem).  Anyone can pick it \
  up and stick it onto a @=b(Totem Pole) to score points.  Totems are \
  neutral until you pick them up, and they will only score you points \
  if YOU place the Totem onto the pole.

m.pick_up_totem = Move your Buffalo Rider on over and pick up that \
  @=b(Totem) piece ahora.

m.got_totem = Bueno!  Now run over next to that @=b(Totem Base) in order to \
  start building your @=b(Totem).  Note that like other scenarios, some spaces \
  are highlighted to show that they will help you with the scenario's goals.

m.built_totem = You may just be a Totem craftsman yet.  Notice that you got a \
  bunch of points for placing that Totem onto the Totem Pole.

m.different_sizes_title = Scoring
m.different_sizes = The Totem you just placed was a @=b(Medium Totem).  \
  There are @=b(Small Totems) and @=b(Large Totems) as well.  Small ones score \
  10 points, medium ones score 20 and large ones score 30.

m.score_one = As an astute Cowpoke, you're no doubt wondering why you have in \
  excess of 80 points when I jus' said that the @=b(Medium Totem) is only worth \
  20 points.

m.score_two = Grab this @=b(Small Totem) over here and I'll explain.

m.score_two_a = Now stack it on top of that same @=b(Totem Pole) \
  and keep an eye on how many points you get.

m.score_three = This time your score went up less, but still more than the 10 \
  points you might have expected.  That's because of something that we call \
  @=b(Totem Pole Points).

m.score_four = There are two kinds of @=b(Totem Pole Points).  El primero, the \
  player that has the most @=b(Totems) on a particular pole, gets a 50 point \
  bonus.

m.score_four_a = That's why your score jumped up after you stuck the first \
  Totem on the pole.  But it didn't jump up as much when you added the \
  second Totem, because you already had the most totems on this pole.

m.score_five = In addition to that, everyone who has Totems on a particular \
  pole gets points based on how tall that pole is.  The taller the pole, the \
  more points it is worth, so try to build them muy alto!

m.score_five_a = You have totems on this pole, so you got some extra points \
  because the pole got taller.  That's why you got more than just 10 points \
  when you put yer @=b(Small Totem) on the pole.

m.score_six = To maximize your @=b(Totem Pole Points), you'll have to strike \
  a good balance between having at least one totem on every pole and having \
  the most totems on some poles.

m.hustle = Qué suerte!  That @=b(Hustle Bonus) will help us to build faster.  \
  A unit with that bonus will never have less than ONE tick.  Move over and \
  pickup that bonus now.

m.fight_bases_title = Fighting Over Poles
m.fight_bases = As I mentioned earlier, anyone can place their Totems onto \
  a Totem Base.  That Thunderbird looks like he's eyeing the pole that we've \
  been working on.

m.attacking = Sí, your opponent is building on it.  Now's \
  a buen time to mention that you can attack @=b(Totem Poles) when the \
  top @=b(Totem) on a pole belongs to your opponent.  You can then attack the \
  pole like any other attack to try to knock their totem off.

m.attack_totem = Ram that @=(Totem Pole) with your @=b(Buffalo Rider) and \
  show that bird that you are serious about your Totems!

m.back_up = Bam!  Notice that the @=b(Damage Indicator) below the pole \
  shows that it has taken some damage.  When that gets down to zero, the top \
  @=b(Totem) will pop off.\n \n\
  First though, move your @=b(Buffalo Rider) far away from that pole so you \
  can get another good running attack.

m.attack_again = Now charge over and knock that pesky Totem right off \
  the pole!\n \n\
  If it doesn't come off with your next hit, you may need one more.  Remember that \
  the further away the @=b(Buffalo Rider) starts from her target the more \
  damage she does.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Muy Bien!  Well amigo, that's all I've got to teach \
  about @=b(Totem Building).\n \n\
  Now that you know how to build up @=b(Totem Poles) and knock 'em down, you'll \
  stack up just fine against your opponents.  Let's get \
  you a reward and keep moving.
