m.welcome_title = Unit Tactics
m.welcome = You may have noticed by now that all units are not equal.  \
  To get the best of yer foes and come out on top of scrapes, you have to \
  use yer units wisely, both in how you attack and who you attack.

m.intro = Take for example this gang of bandits approaching our wagon train \
  lead by that flying Dirigible.  \
  Now, with some smarts on our part we can dispatch them no problem.  Just \
  listen close, and follow my instructions...

m.gunslinger_title = Attack Penalty
m.gunslinger = First, let's send our gunslinger.  Click on her and I'll show \
  you somethin' that you should pay attention to.

m.gunslinger2 = You'll notice that the crosshairs over the Dirigible has a \
  DOWN ARROW in the lower right.  This means that your unit has an ATTACK PENALTY \
  against this enemy unit.  Or in plain english that yer attack is not very effective \
  against this unit.

m.gunslinger3 = Let's attack the Dirigible anyway, just to see what happens.  \
  Go ahead and click on the Crosshairs over the Dirigible to shoot it up.

m.gunslinger4 = Yep, that only did 20 damage points... it'd take a while \
  to take that Dirigible down at that rate.  Gunslingers are great against human \
  units, but have an ATTACK PENALTY against steam robots such as this Dirigible.

m.barrage = Wow, I think we made the other bandit angry!  That artillery is a \
  tough foe.  Notice how it can lob shells from a safe distance away for 50 \
  Damage Points?

m.barrage2 = Ok, stop noticing and start reacting!  We've got a live one here!

m.codger_title = Attack Bonus
m.codger = Now let me get in there and show you a thing or two.  The Codger, \
  yers truely, has an ATTACK BONUS against flying units such as that there \
  Dirigible.\n \n\
  Now click on yer Codger unit. 

m.codger2 = Notice this time that there is an UP ARROW to the right of crosshairs.  \
  This means that yer unit has an ATTACK BONUS, or more plainly, will do more damage \
  against this enemy unit.

m.codger3 = Now go ahead and blast the Dirigible with yer Codger.

m.codger4 = BANG!  That took it clean out o' the sky -- much better than the 20 \
  damage that yer Gunslinger did.  However, Dirigibles don't take kindly to \
  being shot down and will come crashing down on enemy units.

m.get_repair = Ouch!  Fortunately that Repair Bonus will help.  Move yer Codger unit \
  onto that Repair Bonus to return to full health.

m.full_attack_title = Varying Damage
m.full_attack = Much better!  When that Artillery shot me, he moved in range of my \
  Blunderbuss because units with guns can shoot through fences.  Shoot the Artillery now!

m.damage = Take that ya varmint!  That really had some punch with 65 \
  Damage Points!

m.artillery = Zooks!  He's got some fight in him left yet...  Now I've taken \
  25 Damage Points.  Notice that the artillery did less damage after it was \
  damaged itself.  Units do full damage when they have full health, and less \
  and less damage as they lose health.

m.artillery2 = That's why getting the first attack is often key in winning \
  confrontations.  Speakin' of which, click on yer Codger unit and let's win \
  this one.

m.artillery3 = I won't do 65 Damage this next time because I've taken 25 Damage \
  from that shell, but it'll be enough to take 'im out.  Shoot the Artillery again \
  and take note that the damage done will be less than 65.

m.done = Blammo!  That takes care of those would be robbers.  To learn more about \
  the ATTACK PENALTY and ATTACK BONUS of units, you can visit the @=b(Ranch) in town \
  or just hover over units in inventories and menus.

m.done2 = At the @=b(Ranch) you can even practice with units to really get \
  a feel for their strengths and weaknesses.  Let's see, I suppose I owe you a bit \
  more than just my gratitude.  Onwards!
