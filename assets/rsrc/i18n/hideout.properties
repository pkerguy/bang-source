  Once yer in a Gang, you can play unranked <b>Table</b> games with yer \
  fellow Gang members to hone yer skills.  Then, when yer feelin' up to it, \
  try a ranked <b>Competitive</b> game against members of other Gangs. \
  Competitive games earn <b>Aces</b> fer yer Gang, which buy Gang upgrades and \
  shiny doodads fer yer Buckle.<br><br> \
  <p class="help"><span class="cathead">Gang Coffers</span><br> \
  After you've been in the Gang for a week, you can contribute to \
  the Gang's Coffers.  This money goes towards buying new \
  Buckle parts, and upgrades to yer gang's Buckle and Weight Class.  Remember, the \
  Gang's funding depends on Cowpokes Like You!<br><br> \
  <p class="help"><span class="cathead">Top Gangs</span><br> \
  The more Aces you earn, the more notoriety yer Gang gets.  The Top Gangs list \
  shows the top ten Gangs in each Weight Class.<br><br> \
  <p class="help"><span class="cathead">Top Members</span><br> \
