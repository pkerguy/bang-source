m.welcome_title = New Big Shots
m.welcome = We've journeyed deep into the forest.  We're close, very close ahora.  \
  As el general, I say that we be totally prepared for what we might find \
  ahead.  You still need to learn all about the Indian Trading Post @=b(Bigshots).  

m.intro_title = Revolutionary
m.intro = Les' start with me.  I'm the Revolutionary.  We may have met before, but \
  you've not seen me in action.

m.weapons = I have two weapons.  With la @=b(Pistola) I can shoot anything up to two \
  spaces away.  With mi @=b(Saber) I can slash any Ground Unit right next to me, but I \
  will always shoot Air Units because they are too high to slash.

m.attack = Attack that enemy Buffalo Rider now.  Attack from right next to her so that \
  you will do the Saber attack, which does more damage.

m.offense = Mira, I may not be an offensive powerhouse, but I have other abilities \
  too.  Primero, all @=b(Ground Units) under my command gain a @=b(10%) damage \
  bonus while I am alive.  Try it now: finish off that fleeing enemy with your Dog Soldier.   

m.icon = You will notice that to the right of the damage there was a @=b(Fist Icon), which \
  indicated that @=b(10%) was added to the damage of the attack.

m.martyr = Lastly, if I am killed in battle then all your units that are @=b(ALREADY) \
  dead will @=b(IMMEDIATELY) spawn in, instead of waiting their usual Spawn Timeout.  \
  Aye Caramba!

m.stormy_title = Stormcaller
m.stormy = Howdy!  I am the @=b(Stormcaller) Big Shot.  I can call on the cloud \
  spirits to crash down a potentially devastating @=b(Lightning Attack).  

m.stormy2 = My Lightning Attack is especially strong against Air Units because I have \
  an ATTACK BONUS against them.  Like those two rascal Dirigibles over there!  \
  Attack that closer Dirigible now by selecting me then clicking on the Crosshairs.
 
m.stormy3 = Notice that you must be careful where you attack.  Once lightning strikes \
  it will @=b(Chain) for additional damage through any units \
  touching the target up to three deep!  So you can accidentally hurt or even kill \
  friendly units such as that poor Dog Soldier.

m.stormy4 = One of those Dirigibles is running away.  Finish off this closer one with \
  another lightning strike.

m.stormy5 = Well done!  Let's bring out the third Indian Trading Post Big Shot. \
  He'll take it from here and track down that cowardly rascal.

m.tricky_title = Trickster Raven
m.tricky = Hello again.  I am the @=b(Trickster Raven) Big Shot.  I am the master of \
  the air, being able to take flight myself and having an ATTACK BONUS against Air Units.  \
  Before we finish those villains, there is one more thing that I must point \
  out to you about Indian Trading Post.

m.teleporter = This is a @=b(Teleporter).  Any unit that moves onto this will @=b(Teleport) \
  to the other one of it's like color.  If there are more than two of the same color, then \
  the unit will Randomly teleport to one of the open ones.

m.teleport = Move your @=b(Trickster Raven) unit onto that Teleporter.  Note that your \
  Stormcaller can't do it, but I will have no problem flying up that wall, afterall I'm tricky.

m.revenge = I've been teleported to the other Orange @=b(Teleporter).  Now that I'm over here, \
  let's take that bad flyer down.  Shoot that Dirigible!

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = We've taught all we have to teach about the units you'll find in the @=b(Ranch) \
  at Indian Trading Post.  Make sure to visit the Ranch there to learn more about all the \
  units.  Now that you are ready, let's face down what lies ahead!
