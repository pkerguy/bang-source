title = Dr. Steelius

descrip = Dr. Steelius is a tinkerer who has been workin' some bad steam \
  science in order to further his evil landgrabs.  His one weakness may be his \
  overconfidence in his own self proclaimed genius.

round.name = Round the Stead
round.pregame_quote = "You will feel the superiority of the steam bot when I take \
  all of your homesteads away from you.  You cannot stop a Dr. Steelius plan once \
  he, I mean... I set it in motion!"
round.failed_quote = "Those steam units can be a real force when they come stormin' in. \
  Try to have a shotgunner do some heavy damage on both flanks."
round.failed_speaker = 0
round.completed_quote = "You may have bested me here, but don't savor victory too \
  long. There is nothing you can get that I can't take away."

spine.name = Frantic Fight
spine.pregame_quote = "This time Dr. Steelius has a lot of backup.  Try to pick up bonuses \
  and fer goodness sakes, protect me so I can take steads."
spine.pregame_speaker = 0
spine.failed_quote = "Perhaps you do not understand that you cannot compete with me. \
  Dr. Steelius is too smart to be bothered by dullards such as yourself."
spine.completed_quote = "I'm sure the good doctor thinks he is more clever than he \
  actually is.  That ought to bring 'im down a notch."
spine.completed_speaker = 0

ruined.name = Ruined Stand
ruined.pregame_quote = "Aha, Dr. Steelius has caught you this time.  Without your Big Shot \
  all of the steads will be mine easily.  There will be no respawning.  Once your units are \
  ground to dust by my steam army you will be defenseless."
ruined.failed_quote = "I enjoy toying with you. Let us try again, and this time be sure to \
  hold that homestead at all costs. It pains me to see proper tactics ignored."
ruined.completed_quote = "What?!  How can this be?  This is like a monkey winning against a man.  \
  Surely there was a miscalculation somewhere.  No matter, Dr. Steelius will come out on top with \
  sheer brain-power."

slums.name = Mud Fight
slums.pregame_quote = "Dr. Steelius has mustered his last remaining forces for this battle.  \
  If you can hold onto three steads we'll beat his evil steam army once and for all and \
  send him to the jailhouse."
slums.pregame_speaker = 0
slums.failed_quote = "Dr. Steelius has done it again!  Can no one stand up to such dizzying \
  intellect?  Dr. Steelius is in need of a better challenge."
slums.completed_quote = "The unequaled genius of Dr. Steelius defeated by a \
  contemptible RUBE?!  Inconceivable!  Why...why it must be a CONSPIRACY! \
  That's it!  You must have had hidden allies of profound intelligence!  You \
  don't fool me, you...you half-witted hayseed!"
