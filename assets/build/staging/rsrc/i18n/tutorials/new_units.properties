m.welcome_title = New Units
m.welcome = Hola Amigo!  There have been some strange goings-on in the forest, \
  muy extraño.  If you are going to help us investigate, you will need \
  primero to learn to command the new units of @=b(Indian Trading Post). 

m.intro_title = Buffalo Rider
m.intro = I will help you to learn.  I am afterall a revered leader, so listen to \
  my words bien.  This is a @=b(Buffalo Rider).  Her ramming attack can be \
  powerful, but only if she gets a running start.  The damage is proportional to the \
  distance between her and her target.

m.ram = Let's try it on that little Artillery enemy.  Use a simple click attack \
  to ram the enemy unit now.

m.ram2 = Qué bueno!  With a full five spaces of running start, the Buffalo Rider \
  packs a big smash.  Notice too that she pushed the Artillery one space back from \
  the impact side.  This will happen everytime she attacks from at least @=b(three \
  squares) away. 

m.ram3 = Qué malo!  That artillery just snapped up that Repair Bonus right next to \
  your Buffalo Rider.  Let's attack again from this new closer position.

m.ram4 = Notice that from right next to units the Buffalo Rider's attack is very \
  weak.

m.ram5 = Aye!  That enemy @=b(Thunderbird) unit is attacking.  Click on your \
  Buffalo Rider unit and I'll show you something of interest.

m.ram6 = The Buffalo Rider CANNOT attack @=b(Air Units) such as this Thunderbird.  \
  That is why you do not get a Crosshairs over the enemy Thunderbird.  She can only \
  attack other Ground Units as I've shown you before.

m.tbird_title = Thunderbird
m.tbird = Dastardly!  Let's even the odds un poco.  Your Thunderbird Unit has the special \
  @=b(Swooping Attack): it can attack on any square on its WAY to its \
  destination.

m.swoop = That @=b(Firestarter Bonus) will be perfecto.  You can attack AND get that \
  bonus with the Thunderbird in one move.  First, click the Thunderbird unit.  Next, \
  click the spot where that bonus is.  Finally, click an enemy Thunderbird as your target.

m.swoop2 = That swoop attack can really come in handy on maps where there are a lot \
  of things that you want to pick up.  Now, attack that enemy Thunderbird again, this \
  time with the Firestarter! 

m.swoop3 = The Firestarter Bonus will cause \
  units that you hit to burn on fire for a few ticks after the hit for addional damage.  \
  Me gusta fuego!

m.dreamcatcher_title = Dreamcatcher
m.dreamcatcher = This is a @=b(Dreamcatcher) unit.  She catches up dreams and then can \
  throw Nightmare attacks that scare units into running away and losing all of their ticks \
  as they quake in fear.  Quick attack her!

m.scared = Aye!  See how your Thunderbird flew away scared and lost all its ticks?  The \
  dreamcatcher is great for defending areas or for teaming up on an enemy unit and nullifying \
  its attacks.  She also regains a small amount of health on every successful attack.

m.codger = These enemies are muy fuerte.  We need us some more muscle tambien.  There is one more \
  regular unit in the Indian Trading Post...

m.soldier_title = Dog Soldier
m.soldier = This is a @=b(Dog Soldier) unit.  A voracious fighter, he has a strong attack \
  against ground units, but like the Buffalo Soldier cannot hit Air Units.  He is also fearless \
  in battle, staking himself into the ground to ready for any enemy.

m.fearless = Notice that the Dreamcatcher's nightmare attack had @=b(NO EFFECT) on your Dog \
  Soldier?  I told you, he was fearless.  Now let's see how she likes it!  \
  Attack the Dreamcatcher unit.

m.slash = The last thing that the Dog Soldier has, is that he will slash at every adjacent enemy \
  on every tick.  Notice how he keeps slashing that Dreamcatcher?  Maybe she is scared now, no?

m.done_title = Terminado
m.done = To learn more about the units in Indian Trading Post, visit the ITP @=b(Ranch).  There \
  you can practice with these new units and also see all of their ATTACK PENALTIES and BONUSES.  \
  Since you were such a good soldier, I should share some Scrip with you, sí?
