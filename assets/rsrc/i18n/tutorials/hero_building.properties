m.welcome_title = Warpath
m.welcome = As a warrior on the @=b(Warpath), your Big Shot can wield immense power.  \
  Listen closely and I'll show you how to attain that power!

m.bigshot_title = Warpath Levels
m.bigshot = Right now your Big Shot is not looking all that powerful.  See that \
  big 0 over his head?  It's telling you that he's at @=b(Warpath Level 0).  You'll \
  want to help him get that level up as high as possible.

m.hustle = Just like in any other scenario, your Big Shot can pick up bonuses \
  such as that @=b(Hustle) bonus.  This is only part of their potential \
  powerups when they are on the @=b(Warpath) but every bit helps so pick up that \
  hustle now.

m.bigshot2 = You gain @=b(Experience) by killing enemy units.  This experience \
  will increase the level of your Big Shot, giving them more power.

m.bigshot3 = An unsuspecting enemy unit has wandered in.  Quickly, \
  @=b(attack) that Thunderbird until it's dead.

m.level = Good work!  Your Big Shot has gone up to @=b(Warpath Level 1).  You get \
  @=b(50 points) for each level your Big Shot holds, so work hard to keep him at a \
  high level.  If you look at the top of the screen, you can find out what \
  powers he got for this Level.

m.level1 = At level 1 your Big Shot gets a small @=b(Attack and Defense Bonus). \
  Those will increase with each additional level.  

m.level2 = Your Big Shot will also attain \
  other bonus powers at the higher levels.  These bonuses will be in addition to \
  any current active bonus (such as your Hustle) and will appear to the right \
  on the top display.

m.heal_title = Healing Herbs
m.heal = That enemy Revolutionary has really cut you down!  Keeping your \
  Big Shot healthy is key in @=b(Warpath) since dying will cost him some \
  experience and possibly a level.

m.heal1 = Look over there at those @=b(Healing Herbs)!  Those herbs will \
  return some health to your Big Shot if @=b(any) of your units picks them up.  \
  Send your Buffalo Rider over there to grab them.

m.heal2 = See how your Big Shot's health got bumped up?  You'll want to keep an eye \
  open for those @=b(Healing Herbs) and use them when your Big Shot gets into \
  trouble.

m.dead_hero_title = Warpath Respawn
m.dead_hero = Ouch, looks like that Revolutionary meant business.  Don't \
  worry too much though, your Big Shot will always @=b(Respawn) immediately.

m.dead_hero2 = See, he's already back and ready for action!  The \
  rest of your units will always respawn around your Big Shot, so \
  they'll never be far from the action.  However, as your Big Shot \
  reaches higher levels it will take longer and longer for your regular \
  units to respawn.

m.unit_kills_title = Gaining Experience
m.unit_kills = Killing opponents with your regular units will also grant \
  your Big Shot experience, just not as much.  So it's often the better \
  strategy to soften up an opponent with your regular units, then let your \
  Big Shot swoop in for the kill.

m.unit_kills1 = Let's try this out by having your Buffalo Rider attack that \
  pesky Revolutionary.

m.unit_kills2 = Now that he's hurting, finish off the Revolutionary with your \
  Big Shot to gain the most experience.

m.bigshot_death_title = Finito!
m.bigshot_death = That's the way to do it!  I should also point out that when \
  any Big Shot dies, bonuses will come flying out of their fallen form. \
  Higher level Big Shots will produce more and better bonuses for you to \
  collect.
