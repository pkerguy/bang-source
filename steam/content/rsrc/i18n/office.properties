  <p class="help"><span class="cathead">What's a Bounty?</span><br> \
  Bounties are a series of single player games versus a particular \
  <b>Outlaw</b> where each game defines a set of criteria for completion that \
  aren't necessarily the same as the normal criteria for winning a game in that \
  scenario.<br><br>\n\
  For example, a player may be required to end a game with exactly two gold \
  nuggets in their claim, or to finish without losing more than five of their \
  units during the course of the game.<br><br>\n\
  When the player completes all of the games in a Bounty series, they earn a \
  <b>scrip reward</b> and sometimes <b>Badges</b> and other exciting \
  <b>prizes</b>.<br><br>\n\
  <p class="help"><span class="cathead">Town Bounties</span><br>\n\
  The first set of Town Bounties are available for free. The rest of the town \
  bounties are only available to <b>Wranglers</b>. You also have to complete four \
  out of five bounties at a particular difficulty level before you can progress \
  to the next level.<br><br>\n\
  <p class="help"><span class="cathead">Most Wanted Bounties</span><br> \
  Most Wanted Bounties are tougher challenges for Deputies who reckon they've \
  got the skills to take down the most dangerous outlaws. In order to play \
  these bounties, one must be a <b>Wrangler</b> and purchase a <b>Deputy's Star</b> \
  from the <b>General Store</b>. These unlock Most Wanted bounties for a particular \
  difficulty level. Most Wanted bounties have <b>higher payouts</b> and even fancier \
  <b>special rewards</b>.
