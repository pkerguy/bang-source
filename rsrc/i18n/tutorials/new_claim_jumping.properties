m.welcome_title = Claim Jumpin'
m.welcome = Let's stop here at my claim for a bit.  I'm gonna explain \
  a game called @=b(CLAIM JUMPING).  You probably guessed that this game \
  usually involves takin' gold nuggets from claims and the shootin' and \
  fightin' that usually accompanies such actions... and yer right!

m.claim_intro = This here's a claim. This is where ya keep yer gold nuggets. \
  When the game starts, you'll have two nuggets already in yer claim.\n \n\
  Each of those nuggets is worth 50 points. Take a look down \
  below at yer score and notice that ya got 100 points fer these two nuggets.

m.nugget_intro = This here's a gold nugget. Sometimes nuggets are just lyin' \
  around on the ground waitin' fer some lucky prospector to come pick 'em up. \
  Let's give that a try.

m.pick_up_nugget_title = Pickin' Up Nuggets
m.pick_up_nugget = Move one of yer units to the same square as the nugget and \
  that unit will pick it up.

m.got_nugget = You got it!  Now you got to get that nugget back to yer claim \
  without gettin' all shot up by yer opponent. If a unit carryin' a nugget \
  dies, they'll drop the nugget onto the ground nearby.

m.got_nugget2 = For now just move the unit with the nugget over to a highlighted \
  square next to yer claim to deposit that nugget fer safe keepin'.

m.deposited_nugget = Nice work!  Notice that yer score went up by 50 points! \
  As long as that nugget is in yer claim, you'll get the points fer it, but \
  if yer opponent steals it out of yer claim before the game ends, you'll lose \
  them points right quick.

m.stealin_nuggets_title = Stealin' Nuggets
m.stealin_nuggets = Speakin' of that, let's talk about stealin' nuggets \
  from yer opponent's claim.  Luckily, this one isn't protected.\n \n\
  This here's yer opponent's claim.  If ya land yer unit on \
  a square next to this claim, you'll swipe a nugget from yer opponent.

m.stealin_nuggets2 = Let's give it a try.  Walk either unit on over there and \
  get some of that shiny gold!  Notice that the squares next to the claim \
  are fancy lookin' to denote that this is a good place fer you to park a unit.

m.stole_nugget = Yer a real pro!  Notice that yer opponent's score dropped by \
  50 points.  That's a dang shame!

m.stole_nugget2 = However, ya got to get that nugget back to yer own claim \
  before you'll get any points fer it.  A nugget out in the field is about as \
  worthless as a wagon with no wheels.  It's got to be in yer claim to score!\n \n\
  Head back over and deposit that nugget lickety split.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Now ya got the hang of it pardner!  There ain't much more to tell \
  'cept that in a real game yer gonna have ta duke it out against some other \
  cowpokes who'll be aimin' ta steal yer own nuggets.

m.done2 = You'll have to work out a strategy to protect yer claim and get out \
  there and scoop up some o' them nuggets.  No doubt you'll do a fine job, and \
  if it's MY nuggets yer protectin' you'd be wise to do it well!  I suppose I \
  should share the wealth, here's somethin' fer yer troubles...
