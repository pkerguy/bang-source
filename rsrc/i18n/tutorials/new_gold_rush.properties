m.welcome_title = Gold Rush
m.welcome = There's gold up on this thar hill!  Let's explain to ya \
  how the @=b(Gold Rush) scenario works.  It's a bit like @=b(Claim Jumpin') \
  but there are some differences of strategic importance.  My friend here \
  happens to be an expert at strategic matters, take it away...

m.tactician = Greetings Pardner!  I am the @=b(Tactician), the third \
  @=b(Big Shot) in Frontier Town.  Let's get down to this business of @=b(Gold Rush).

m.claim_intro = This here's your @=b(Steam Tank).  This is where you stash your \
  gold nuggets.  When the game starts you will have zero nuggets, but \
  there will be nuggets scattered around for you to pick up.

m.nugget_intro_title = Get Nuggets
m.nugget_intro = Here's a gold nugget.  You want to pick this up by landing \
  on it with any of your units and take it back to yer Tank to score points, just \
  like in Claim Jumping.  Each nugget you get back to yer Tank is worth 50 points.

m.nugget_intro2 = Move your Tactician unit onto the nugget to pick it up.

m.get_nugget = Excellent!  Now you got to get that nugget back to your Tank \
  without gettin' all shot up by yer opponent, like that @=b(Sharpshooter) unit \
  right there!

m.got_shot = Egads, too late!  The Sharpshooter will always shoot out whatever \
  a unit is carrying when she hits: like my nugget that just went flying to \
  the ground nearby.

m.repair = Now, the fool might go pick that nugget up again, only to get it \
  shot right back out of his hands.  Whereas the smart fellow will think to \
  take out that Sharpshooter first.

m.repair2 = Ah!  She just got that nugget while I was a'jawin' on!\n \n\
  As I was saying... the smart fellow will take out the Sharpshooter first, BUT the \
  even smarter fellow will get that there Repair Bonus @=b(AND) shoot her, the best \
  move strategically speakin'.

m.repair3 = Do a move and shoot now: click onto the ground tile where that Repair \
  Bonus is, then click on the Sharpshooter as your target.

m.kill = Great!  I told you it pays to be smart: being at full health to shoot \
  her did twice as much damage as it would at half health.  Now, finish her off before \
  she makes a run for her Tank!

m.got_nugget_title = Deposit Nuggets
m.got_nugget = Ok, now that the coast is clear, go on and pickup that nugget again.

m.got_nugget2 = Finally, move your Tactician over to a square next to \
  your Tank to deposit that nugget for safe keepin'.

m.deposited_nugget = Perfecto! Notice that yer score went up by 50 \
  points!

m.deposited_nugget2 = An important thing to know about @=b(Gold Rush) is that \
  you @=b(CAN NOT) steal nuggets from yer opponents' Tanks.  Once ya get a \
  nugget into your Tank it's safe and sound.

m.lodes_title = Lodes
m.lodes = There will always be at least one nugget in play for each player in \
  the game. Once someone gets a nugget into their Tank, a new one will show up \
  somewhere else on the board, like this one did.

m.new_nugget = Go and get that new nugget!\n \n\
  The new nuggets will appear at certain spots around the board.  Keep track \
  of where them nuggets show up because there's a good chance more nuggets will \
  show up there later.

m.gunslinger = Egads!  Those revolvers pack a punch against Human Units such \
  as myself.  I won't be able to make it back with this nugget alive unless...

m.iron_plate = Great Gravy, that @=b(Iron Plate Bonus) will do just the trick!  \
  Move your Tactician unit onto that Iron Plate quick.

m.iron_plate2 = The Iron Plate Bonus makes the unit take NO damage from \
  enemy fire for 8 ticks.  That's why that pesky Gunslingers bullets all \
  went bouncing off for zero damage.

m.deposit_again = Now get that nugget in there and we'll call it a day!  \
  Click on a square next to your Tank.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Just like in the other scenarios, the more points ya get, the higher \
  yer rank at the end of the round and the more scrip ya earn.\n \n\
  Speakin' of scrip, a job well done deserves a reward.  You go \
  on to the Wagons, I'll clean things up here.
