m.welcome_title = Forest Guardians
m.welcome = This is it!  Somethin' here is threatening the @=b(Trees) \
  of the forests!  It would be a great shame if these Trees were all destroyed: \
  everyone would lose then.  We must all be @=b(Forest Guardians) and protect them.

m.intro = The first thing you need to know about @=b(Forest Guardians) is that \
  it is a cooperative scenario.  Everyone knows to save these Trees, so other \
  cowpokes will be workin' WITH you.  You cannot shoot other Players because \
  they are your allies.

m.tree_bed = Let's start with growin' Trees.  This here is a @=b(Tree Bed). \
  With a little care and attention, it will grow into a majestic \
  @=b(Elder Tree).

m.move_grow = The way you help a Tree to grow is to park a unit next to it. \
  Let's get this Tree growing.  Move your @=b(Trickster Raven) over next to that \
  @=b(Tree Bed) and it will start to sprout up.

m.growth_phases1_title = Phases of Growth
m.growth_phases1 = Notice that the @=b(Damage Indicator) at the bottom of \
  the Tree is slowly filling in.  With more units near the tree, it will grow \
  even faster.  As the Tree grows it will progress through its @=b(Phases of Growth).

m.growth_phases2 = As the Tree proceeds from 0 to 100 health, it proceeds \
  through each @=b(Phase): @=b(Tree Bed) to @=b(Sapling) to @=b(Mature Tree) \
  and finally to @=b(Elder Tree).

m.growth_phases3 = However not all is well, something has been attacking the Trees \
  in the forest.  Trees can take damage.  If a Tree ever drops to zero health it \
  dies and becomes a @=b(Stump) and cannot be revived.

m.logging_robots1_title = Logging Robots!
m.logging_robots1 = There!  That must be who has been trying to destroy the trees!  \
  It's those dastardly @=b(Logging Robots).  Those evil bots won't rest until \
  they've chopped down every tree in the forest.

m.logging_robots2 = Logging Robots try to park next to a Tree so they can @=b(Saw) \
  it on every tick.  Get 'im before it gets to your tree and chops it down.  \
  Watch out for his long range @=b(Buzzsaw Attack) at your units!

m.logging_robots3 = Good work.  Those robots are tough.  That was just one, but \
  usually they come in packs.  Grab that @=b(Repair Bonus) before more show up.

m.waves1_title = Makin' Waves
m.waves1 = Another important thing to know about @=b(Forest Guardians) is \
  that the scenario proceeds in waves.  At the start of each wave, new \
  @=b(Tree Beds) appear at various locations around the board.

m.waves2 = Then shortly after that, the @=b(Logging Robots) drop in \
  and the fight begins!  Your job during the wave is to get all the trees on \
  the board to the @=b(Elder Tree) phase and then destroy any \
  @=b(Logging Robots) that are left on the board.

m.waves3 = At that point the wave ends. As long as you managed to save \
  at least half of the trees on the board, you progress to the next \
  difficulty level.  Higher difficulty means that more and tougher \
  @=b(Logging Robots) show up to the party.

m.more_kinds1_title = Different Robots
m.more_kinds1 = Oh, I forgot to mention, there ain't just @=b(Logging Robots). \
  There's also @=b(Locust Robots), who can leap like a gazelle and have a \
  terrifyin' @=b(Wing Blade Attack).

m.more_kinds2 = What d'ya know, there's one now!  Quick, dispatch him before \
  he turns all yer hard work into sawdust.

m.more_kinds3 = Good riddance! Them @=b(Locust Robots) are scary because with \
  one swipe they can deal heavy damage to Trees.  To tell the truth, I've heard \
  rumors that there are @=b(Super Logging Robots) and @=b(Super Locust Robots), \
  but I don't know if I believe that hogwash.

m.fetishes1_title = Fetishes
m.fetishes1 = Next thing I should tell you about are what we call \
  @=b(Fetishes).  No, not that kind of fetish!  Go get a dictionary and learn \
  yourself something about the English language.

m.fetishes2 = These @=b(Fetishes) grant @=b(Special Powers) to the unit that \
  is carryin' 'em during the game.

m.fetishes3 = @=b(Fetishes) work just like the @=b(Talisman) in @=b(Wendigo \
  Attack) or @=b(Nuggets) from way back in @=b(Claim Jumping).  Your unit moves \
  onto 'em to pick 'em up and they keep carrying 'em until the fetish is shot \
  out of their hand or they die.

m.fetishes4 = This is a @=b(Turtle Fetish).  It causes the unit that's \
  carryin' it to take half as much damage as normal.  How about \
  ya walk over and pick that thing up?

m.fetishes5 = Here's a tip.  When your unit is carryin' a fetish, you \
  can hold down the @=b(Control key) and hover the mouse over the unit to see \
  what kind of fetish they're carryin' and what its special powers are.

m.fetishes6 = There are three more types of fetish: the @=b(Bear Fetish), \
  the @=b(Frog Fetish) and the @=b(Fox Fetish).  They'll be scattered around \
  the board when the game starts.

m.fetishes7 = When ya see 'em, do the same thing I just told you: hold down \
  the @=b(Control key) and move your mouse over them to learn what sort of \
  @=b(Special Power) they grant to your unit.

m.scoring1_title = Scoring
m.scoring1 = I'm almost done talkin', but first I should explain Scoring in \
  Forest Guardians.  As mentioned, this is a co-op scenario so you're all \
  workin' together to save the Trees.  That means the payout at the end of \
  the game depends on how everyone does, not just your performance.

m.scoring2 = If you and your teammates make it through a lot of waves and save \
  a high percentage of Trees then you'll get a good score and y'all will get a \
  high payout.  If y'all don't do so well, you get less.  Simple as that.

m.scoring3 = There's one wrinkle though, to make things interesting.  You still \
  have a score at the end of the round that reflects how well you contributed \
  to the shared goal.  Based on that, there will be slight variations in payouts \
  for these differences.

m.done1_title = Finito!
m.done1 = Alright pardner.  You helped us solve the mystery of what was troubling \
  the forests.  You now are one of the  @=b(Forest Guardians).  I hope you also \
  remember your @=b(Totem Building) skills and how to survive a @=b(Wendigo Attack).

m.done2 = We'll leave you here in @=b(Indian Trading Post).  Remember to visit the \
  @=b(Ranch) to practice with any of the new units, and that you can always come \
  jouney with us if you forget something.  Oh, I almost forgot... I should reward \
  you for your good work!
